🚀 AI-Powered Debugging Assistant for Python Errors

📌 Project Overview
The goal is to build an intelligent debugging assistant that processes Python error messages, retrieves relevant solutions, ranks them, and presents an optimal fix. The project will follow a structured development pipeline to ensure efficiency, scalability, and future compatibility with Azure Cloud.
🔹 High-Level Milestones
	Core Development (Local Prototype)
		🏗 Phase 1: Error Extraction & Preprocessing
		🔍 Phase 2: Error Retrieval & Solution Search
		🎯 Phase 3: Solution Ranking & Explanation
		🚀 Phase 4: Prototype Development & Optimization
	Future Expansion
		🌍 Phase 5: Scaling & Azure Deployment (Post-Prototyping, Not Focused Now)
Each phase is broken into step-by-step goals to ensure smooth progress.

🏗 Phase 1: Error Extraction & Preprocessing
💡 Extract structured information from Python stack traces to use in retrieval.
🎯 Goals
✅ Goal 1: Parse Stack Trace & Extract Error Details
	Implement a function that extracts:
		Exception Type (e.g., KeyError, TypeError)
		Error Message (contextual details)
		File & Line Number (if applicable)
	Normalize extracted details (removing system-specific noise).
	Test extraction with at least 20+ real-world Python errors from various sources.
✅ Goal 2: Handle Edge Cases & Uncommon Errors
	Ensure error parsing works for:
		Common Python errors (ZeroDivisionError, IndexError, AttributeError)
		Library-specific errors (TensorFlow, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
		Multi-line stack traces
✅ Goal 3: Structure the Output for Later Use
	Standardize output format:

```json
CopyEdit
{
  "exception": "KeyError",
  "message": "'username' not found in dictionary",
  "file": "app.py",
  "line": 25
}
	```
	Ensure output format is flexible enough for cloud scaling (i.e., can be sent as JSON via an API).
⏳ Expected Timeframe: 3-5 Days
🚨 Potential Challenge: Handling variations in stack traces across libraries.

🔍 Phase 2: Error Retrieval & Solution Search
💡 Find relevant fixes from Stack Overflow using RAG or web search.
🎯 Goals
✅ Goal 1: Choose a Retrieval Strategy (RAG or Web Search?)
	Test RAG:
		Create a small dataset (~5k Python errors + fixes from Stack Overflow).
		Use CodeBERT or Sentence-Transformers to generate embeddings.
		Store in FAISS/ChromaDB and check retrieval accuracy.
	Test Web Search:
		Query "site:stackoverflow.com <error message>" using Google/Bing API.
		Scrape & extract relevant answers.
	Decide on Approach:
		If RAG accuracy >70%, use it.
		If RAG is inconsistent, use a Hybrid Approach (RAG + Web Search Backup).
✅ Goal 2: Implement & Optimize Chosen Approach
	If using RAG:
		Expand dataset to ~50k Python errors for better results.
		Optimize FAISS indexing method (HNSW vs. Flat).
	If using Web Search:
		Optimize query structuring (exact match, "inurl:questions").
		Handle response rate limits & failures.
⏳ Expected Timeframe: 4-6 Days
🚨 Potential Challenge: RAG might not generalize well to all errors.

🎯 Phase 3: Solution Ranking & Explanation
💡 Rank solutions and generate a human-readable explanation.
🎯 Goals
✅ Goal 1: Rank Solutions Based on Relevance & Recency
	Retrieve top 5 solutions and rank based on:
		Semantic similarity to the error message.
		Upvotes on Stack Overflow.
		Recency (favor solutions from last 5 years).
	Combine these into a scoring system (e.g., weighted sum model).
✅ Goal 2: Summarize & Explain Fixes Using LLM
	Use Llama-3 or GPT-4 to:
		Summarize the error’s root cause.
		Format the best fix in structured steps.
✅ Goal 3: Evaluate & Reduce Hallucinations
	Avoid generating incorrect fixes.
	Keep explanations concise (max 2-3 sentences).
⏳ Expected Timeframe: 3-5 Days
🚨 Potential Challenge: LLMs may generate irrelevant explanations if not guided properly.

🚀 Phase 4: Prototype Development & Optimization
💡 Wrap everything into a usable system before expanding.
🎯 Goals
✅ Goal 1: Build a CLI Prototype
	Users should be able to:
		Input a Python stack trace.
		Get a structured error diagnosis + ranked solution.
		Receive a formatted explanation.
✅ Goal 2: Develop an API (FastAPI)
	Convert the CLI into a FastAPI-based backend.
	Structure API response:

```json
CopyEdit
{
  "error": "ZeroDivisionError",
  "cause": "Division by zero is undefined.",
  "suggested_fix": "Ensure denominator is not zero before division.",
  "alternative_fixes": ["Use exception handling to catch ZeroDivisionError."]
}
	```
	Keep API stateless for future cloud scaling.
✅ Goal 3: Benchmark & Optimize Latency
	Measure retrieval speed: Should be <1s.
	Optimize database indexing & API response times.
⏳ Expected Timeframe: 4-7 Days
🚨 Potential Challenge: Ensuring API is cloud-compatible from the start.

🌍 Phase 5: Scaling & Azure Cloud Deployment (Future Step, Not Now)
💡 Once the prototype works, move it to the cloud.
✅ Ensure early design choices don’t block cloud deployment:
	Use containerization (Docker) from the start.
	Make sure API is stateless (so it can scale horizontally).
	Store embeddings in a distributed vector DB (e.g., Weaviate, Pinecone, Azure Cognitive Search).
⏳ Timeframe: 🚀 Future Step After Local Success
🚨 Potential Challenge: Cloud costs and API scalability.

📅 Overall Timeline
Phase	Duration
Phase 1: Error Processing	3-5 Days
Phase 2: Retrieval & Search	4-6 Days
Phase 3: Solution Ranking & Explanation	3-5 Days
Phase 4: Prototype (CLI & API)	4-7 Days
Phase 5: Cloud Scaling	Future
📌 Total Expected Time: ~2.5 to 3 Weeks for Prototype

🔥 Final Thoughts
1️⃣ Start with error extraction (everything depends on it).
2️⃣ Validate retrieval method (RAG vs. Web Search) early.
3️⃣ Optimize ranking & explanations before scaling.
4️⃣ Keep API design cloud-ready from the beginning.
